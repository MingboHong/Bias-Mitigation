| **Data Source**      | Rendered images from simulators or 3D models (e.g., ShapeNet, GTA5)                         | Real-world images captured under varying conditions (e.g., different cities, devices)   |
| **Typical Datasets** | Syn2Real, GTA5 â†’ Cityscapes, Virtual KITTI â†’ KITTI                                          | Cityscapes â†’ ACDC, Office-31, VisDA-C                                             |
| **Bias Types**  | - **Style Bias**: Synthetic images often lack realistic textures and noise<br>- **Lighting Bias**: Differences in illumination between synthetic and real images<br>- **Background Bias**: Simplified or unrealistic backgrounds in synthetic data | - **Device Bias**: Variations causesd by cameras or sensors<br>- **Environmental Bias**: Changes in weather, time (Low-light: illuminations, sensor's noise), or location<br>- **Background Bias**: Diverse real-world backgrounds affecting object appearance |
